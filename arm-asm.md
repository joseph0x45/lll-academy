# Why learn ASM assembly
- Computation
- Learning
- Market share

## Computation
ARM assembly is becoming computationnally more efficient than other CPU architectures out there
RISC: Reduced Instruction Set Computers
CISC: Complex Instruction Set Computers

Intel is very complex and has a lot of optimizations built in under the hood. It makes it the most power hungry
and the most heat dissipating architecture. Because of that it is losing market in embedded and laptop space. ARM is more efficient.

## Learning
It strikes a good balance from a learning perspective of being simple and pretty easy to get started with.
Intel is a CISC, ARM is a RISC, it is much more approachable for beginners.

## Market share
We are seeing a resurgence of ARM chips on the market. ARM is dominating the embedded space.
